The crux of this thesis is not about the theory we have presented in the other chapters, but rather to see how well these algorithms work in practice, if at all. We have implemented most of the algorithms mentioned in the paper, and in this chapter we will present the codebase. Of course, we invite the reader to explore the repository on their own: \cite{source:codebase}.

\section{Language}
Our library is written in Rust. We chose that language because of performance, but also because its type system and strict compiler helps massively in reducing the developer overhead during development. Being able to fearlessly perform large refactors, and to use sum-types rather than just product types to describe the data, has had a huge impact on the quality of our code. \todo{Skrive mer her?
