\section{Testing}
The repository includes a large test suite, to ensure the correctness of everything we have implemented. First of all, each data structure comes with its own set of unit tests. Secondly, we have a total of 17 hand-crafted graphs of various shapes and sizes, and for each of them we have many queries for the different graph problems. We have found the optimal solutions manually and confirmed that the expected answers match the answers provided by the algorithms. Lastly, we have numerous problem-specific assertions in place, like asserting that the output of \textsc{Shortest Odd Path} really is a path, or that the output of \textsc{Network Diversion} indeed cuts the graph in two except for the diversion edge.

These tests have been immensely helpful in the development of our algorithms. Whenever we modified anything, we could instantly verify the validity with just the press of a hotkey and its subsequent run of the test suites. Though we do not present many formal proofs for the algorithms in this thesis, we like to think of the tests as informal proofs by empirical analysis.
