\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Limitations}
Whether \textsc{Network Diversion} in the general case can be solved in polynomial time is still an open problem.
This algorithm does not solve the general case, but rather the special case where the input graph...
\begin{itemize}
    \item is planar,
    \item is undirected,
    \item has edges of either non-negative weights or no weights at all.
\end{itemize}

In addition, even though the algorithm as described here will also work on non-simple graphs, we implemented the algorithm with the assumption that the graph is simple. See \Cref{chapter:codebase} for more details. \todo{vurder å skrive dette i kodekapitlet istedet. Eller også ta med at vi trenger en straight-line embedding.}
