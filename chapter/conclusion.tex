The main topic of this thesis is to solve \textsc{Shortest Odd Path} on undirected graphs. We have given a detailed explanation and pseudocode of Derigs' \cite{source:derigs_shortest_odd_path} algorithm, with improvements in both its presentation and performance. After that, we used it to give the first-ever efficient algorithm for \textsc{Network Diversion} on planar graphs with non-negative edges. Although requiring planarity and non-negative weights may seem very restrictive, in practical use many graphs fit the criteria.

We have also given algorithms to solve some minor problems like \textsc{Shortest Odd Walk} and \textsc{Shortest Detour Path}. We have successfully implemented all of these algorithms in Rust and tested them thoroughly. All algorithms have been benchmarked to show that their theoretical running times match them in practice. In particular, we show that we can solve \textsc{Shortest Odd Path} and \textsc{Network Diversion} on sparse graphs of 200000 vertices in 0.5s and 1.8s, respectively.
