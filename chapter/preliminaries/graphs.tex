\section{Graphs}
In algorithms, we often use graphs as an abstract structure to represent the fundamental problem behind an algorithms problem without distractions. For example, when you want to find the fastest route to walk to the study hall, or if you want the cheapest combination of flights to take you to Kuala Lumphur, then both questions are really the same problem. If we remove all the details that are unnecessary to solve the problem, like the names of the airports and whether we are walking or flying, then we end up with a graph.

\begin{definition}[Graph]
    A \emph{graph} $G := (V, E, from, to)$ is given by
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$, a collection of \emph{vertices}
    \item $E$, a collection of \emph{edges}
    \item $from : E \rightarrow V$, a mapping from each edge to its source vertex
    \item $to : E \rightarrow V$, a mapping from each edge to its target vertex 
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Weighted graph]
    A \emph{weighted graph} $G := (V, E, from, to, w)$ is a graph, where $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the \emph{weight} of each edge. If a graph is not weighted, we often treat it like it is weighted with all edges having unit weight, a weight of 1. An algorithm intended for weighted graphs will therefore often work on unweighted graph as well.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Directed and undirected graphs]
    Let $G$ be a graph. $G$ is said to be an \emph{undirected graph} if each edge has an opposite: $\forall e \in E \exists e' \in E : reverse(e) == e'$.
    If $G$ is not undirected, we say that $G$ is a \emph{directed graph}.
    Edges in directed graphs are often drawn as arrows, while edges in undirected graphs can be drawn using just a line.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Neighbourhood]
    Let $G$ be a graph, and let $u \in V$ be a vertex in the graph. The \emph{neighbourhood} of $u$, commonly denoted as either $N(u)$ or $G[u]$, is defined as the vertices in $G$ that are reachable from $u$ using just a single edge: $N(u) := \{ to(e)  ~|~  e \in E, ~ from(e) == u\}$.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Walk]
    A \emph{walk} $P := [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k]$ in a graph $G$ is a sequence of edges where each edge ends where the next one starts: $\forall i \in \{1,2,..,k-1\} : to(p_i) = from(p_{i+1})$.
    If $s := from(p_1)$ and $t := to(p_k)$, we say that $P$ is an \emph{$s$-$t$-walk} in $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Path]
    A \emph{path} $P := [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k]$ in a graph $G$ is a walk with the extra requirement that each vertex is used more than once: $\forall i, j \in \{1,2,..,k\} : j \neq {i+1} \rightarrow to(p_i) \neq from(p_j)$.
    If $s := from(p_1)$ and $t := to(p_k)$, we say that $P$ is path from $s$ to $t$, or an \emph{$s$-$t$-path} in $G$.
    Note that in some literature, a walk is referred to as a path, and a path is referred to as a \emph{simple} path. In this thesis, when we refer to paths they are always simple, meaning that they never repeat any vertices. If any vertices are repeated, we will refer to it as a walk.    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cycle]
    A \emph{cycle} in a graph is a walk that ends in the same vertex it started. If it does not repeat any vertices other than the start and end vertex, then we call is a \emph{simple cycle}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[The cost of a path (/walk)]
    Let $P := [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k]$ be a path (/walk) in a weighted graph $G$. The \emph{cost} of $P$ is defined as the sum of its edges: $\sum_{i=1}^k w(p_i)$. In a collection of paths (/walks), we say that the \emph{shortest} path (/walk) is the \emph{cheapest} one, the one with the lowest cost. Likewise for the longest and most expensive path (/walk). Note that in some literature, \emph{shortest} may instead mean \emph{fewest edges}, and the term \emph{length} could mean both the number of edges or the cost of a path. For that ambiguous reason, we will from now on avoid the word \emph{length}, and \emph{shortest} will always mean \emph{cheapest}.
\end{definition}

Now we are ready to define the underlying problem of the example we started with. Both problems can be represented by an abstract graph, where we want to find the shortest path from one vertex to another. From a computational perspective, it does not matter whether the edges are roads or flights, or whether the vertices are crossroads or airports. Vertices and edges can therefore represent whatever we want them to.

This thesis will focus on a curious variant of the Shortest Path problem, called Shortest Odd Path:

\fbox{\parbox{0.94\textwidth}{\textsc{Shortest Odd Path}\\
    \textbf{Input:} A graph $G$, two vertices $s,t \in V$\\
    \textbf{Output:} the shortest $s$-$t$-path in $G$ that uses an odd number of edges
}}

% TODO definere selve Dijkstra's algoritme? Den er jo relevant både for Shortest Odd Path og Shortest Odd Walk.

% TODO kanskje skrive litt til her før vi kommer med flere definisjoner? Hvorfor bryr vi oss?

\begin{definition}[Components of a graph]
    Let $G$ be an undirected graph. A component in $G$ is a set of vertices of $G$ where all vertices in the component have paths to all other vertices in the component. Moreover, this must be a \emph{maximal} set: no other vertices in the graph can be added to the component and keep this property.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Connected graph]
    We say that an undirected graph is a \emph{connected} graph if it has only one component.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cut]
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be an connected and undirected graph. A \emph{cut} $\mathbb{C} \subseteq E$ of $G$ is a subset of edges such that $(V, E \setminus \mathbb{C})$ is an unconnected graph of exactly two components. If $s,t \in V$ end up in separate components after the cut, we denote $\mathbb{C}$ as an $s$-$t$-\emph{cut} in $G$.
