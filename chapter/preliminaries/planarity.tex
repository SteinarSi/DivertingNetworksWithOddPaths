\section{Planarity}

TODO little introduction here, why do we care

\begin{definition}[Planar graph]
    Let $G$ be a graph. We say that $G$ is a \emph{planar graph} if it is possible to draw the graph on the plane such that none of the edges intersect each other. Such a drawing is referred to as an \emph{embedding} of $G$.
\end{definition}

TODO figures of planar and non-planar graphs.

\begin{definition}[Duality of planar graphs]
    Let $G$ be a planar graph, and choose any embedding of $G$ in the plane.
    
    
    TODO contiue the definition. WTF is a face?
    What \emph{is} the dual graph?
\end{definition}
