\chapter{Introduction}

\todo[inline]{talk about Shortest Path, how cool of a problem it is, and how we have solved it in a bunch of different ways already.}
\todo[inline]{then talk about Shortest Odd Path, how strange it is in comparison, and that we care because acutally useful problems are easier with such a subprocedure.}
\todo[inline]{then talk about network diversion, and how it is actually a useful problem to solve.}
