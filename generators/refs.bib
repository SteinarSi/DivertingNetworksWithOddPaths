    abstract = {We discuss the complexity of finding a cycle of even length in a digraph. In particular, we observe that finding a cycle of prescribed parity through a prescribed edge is NP-complete. Also, we settle a problem of Lovász [11] and disprove a conjecture of Seymour [15] by describing, for each natural number k, a digraph of minimum outdegree k and with no even cycle. We prove that a digraph of order n and minimum outdegree [log2n] + 1 contains, for each edge set E, a cycle containing an even number of edges of E and we show that this is best possible. A modification of the construction yields counterexamples to Hamidoune's conjecture [5] on local connectivity in digraphs of large indegrees and outdegrees.},

    abstract  = {In this paper we discuss a new type of query in Spatial Databases, called the Trip Planning Query (TPQ). Given a set of points of interest P in space, where each point belongs to a specific category, a starting point S and a destination E, TPQ retrieves the best trip that starts at S, passes through at least one point from each category, and ends at E. For example, a driver traveling from Boston to Providence might want to stop to a gas station, a bank and a post office on his way, and the goal is to provide him with the best possible route (in terms of distance, traffic, road conditions, etc.). The difficulty of this query lies in the existence of multiple choices per category. In this paper, we study fast approximation algorithms for TPQ in a metric space. We provide a number of approximation algorithms with approximation ratios that depend on either the number of categories, the maximum number of points per category or both. Therefore, for different instances of the problem, we can choose the algorithm with the best approximation ratio, since they all run in polynomial time. Furthermore, we use some of the proposed algorithms to derive efficient heuristics for large datasets stored in external memory. Finally, we give an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets.},
